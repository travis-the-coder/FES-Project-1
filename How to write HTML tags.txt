How to write HTML tags:

> Elements names are surrounded by angle brackets
> Tag elements usually come in pairs (Start and end tag)
> Some tags close themselves

Examples:
- <h1>Example</h1>
- <br /> (self closing tag)
- <br> (is fine with HTML5)

Inline vs Block:

> Block elements start on a new line and take the full width available
> Inline Elements do not start on a new line and take only the necessary width

Examples of the following elements:
- Block level: <div>, <h1> -> <h6>,<p> 
- Inline level: <span>, <a>, <button>

If you want to add a link to you website:
<a href="https://YourWebsiteHere or Path Here" target="_blank">Name of your page here</a>


Lists:
Ordered Lists: Usually expressed with A,B,C... or 1,2,3.
Unordered Lists: Lists where order does not matter.

Example:

Unordered list:
 <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Land 100k+ job</li>
          <li>Finish Frontend Simplified</li>
          <li>Network with other people in the same discord Server</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

 Ordered List:
        <section>
      <h1>Land 100k+ job</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Finish Frontend Simplified</li>
        <li>Study for interviews</li>
        <li>Apply to jobs</li>
      </ol>


Tid-bits:

Think of the following tags as different parts of the body:

--> <header></header> - This is the same has your head or top. The information that you put in these tags will show at the very top.
